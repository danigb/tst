* .only on the parent test should run all the included tests
* force done if test error happened, do not wait for it to be called
* make stack trace not worse than mocha
* make parent only test run all itâ€™s children
* async tests throw uncatchable errors in callbacks (in browser), in settimeouts
* assertion error in chrome looks unwieldy.
	* that is because of redefining this.stack in error.
	* maybe use [stack-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stack-utils) or alike?
	* an idea - to capture stack on test start, to see at least the entry point. And then parse with stacktrace-parser or alike.
* async errors loose good stacktrace :(
* add href-grep for browser tests, like #5.
* add links in browser console to trigger hash-href
